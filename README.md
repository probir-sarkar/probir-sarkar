## About Me

Hi, I'm Probir, a full-stack developer passionate about building scalable and performant web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). I have experience in developing and deploying web applications using these technologies, as well as integrating them with other APIs and services. I love learning new things and challenging myself. I have completed several online courses and certifications on topics such as MongoDB, Next.js, Agile with Atlassian Jira and Modern Web Design. I also enjoy working on personal projects such as Taskify, a to-do app built with React, Redux and Firebase, and Tic Tac Toe, a game built with React and an external API.
